# Logical Circuit Laboratory


This repository contains **6 Proteus and Fritzing projects** that I completed during my Logical Circuit lab course.
Each project has a corresponding report that describes its implementation. The project descriptions are available in the `report.pdf` file.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project folder you're interested in.
3. Read the project report to understand the implementation details.

Feel free to explore the code and learn from it! If you have any questions or need further clarification, don't hesitate to reach out.
